# Angular Practice

This repository contains my practice work while learning **Angular**, covering core concepts like components, data binding, services, routing, forms, and API integration.

---

## Topics Covered

- Components & Data Binding
- Services and Dependency Injection
- Routing and Navigation
- Template-driven and Reactive Forms
- HTTP Client and API Calls

---

## How I Practiced

- Created separate components and services for each topic.
- Followed a step-by-step approach: Components → Binding → Services → Routing → Forms → HTTP.
- Worked on form validations and API integrations.
- Regular commits to track progress.
